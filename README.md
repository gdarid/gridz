# Gridz

Gridz is a Python tool used for generating images

There is a streamlit application here : [Gridz](https://gdarid-gridz.streamlit.app/)

Please have a look at the "sample_images" folder to see examples of generated images

This image generation tool is inspired from [Lindenmayer Systems.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)

## Setup Instructions

Install required Python modules

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use cases

1. To view or execute the files, please refer to "samples*.py"
2. The resulting images will be stored in the "sample_images" directory
3. Consider slightly increasing the number of iterations to enhance the image quality
4. Alternatively, reducing the number of iterations will expedite the process

## Notes

This project is an ongoing personal project (with documentation and redesign currently in progress). 

The unit tests have not been written yet, and unfortunately, type hinting has not been implemented yet.
